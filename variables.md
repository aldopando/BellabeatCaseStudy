## How the data was tracked?

Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

## Which core stats does my Fitbit device track automatically?

All Fitbit devices track **steps** taken  and **Active Zone Minutes**  or **active minutes** . Additional core stats vary based on your device. Choose to track a variety of other stats, including sleep, exercise, water and food intake, weight, and menstrual health in the Fitbit app.

## How does my Fitbit device count steps taken?

Fitbit devices use a 3-axis accelerometer to count your steps. This sensor also allows your device to determine the frequency, duration, intensity, and patterns of your movement.


## Which activities does my Fitbit device track automatically?

Most Fitbit devices automatically recognize and record high-movement activities through the SmartTrack feature. Certain Fitbit devices also detect workouts and automatically open the Exercise app.
To start, your device recognizes activities at least 15 minutes long.
***You can choose which activities your device tracks automatically, or change the amount of time needed to record the activity.***

| SmartTrack Activities |

| Walk |
| Run|
|Outdoor Bike|
|Elliptical|

## How to manually log exercises in the Fitbit app

If you forgot to wear your Fitbit device or you want to record an activity that isn't detected automatically, manually log the exercise.
You can record the **exercise type** and **duration of the exercise.**

## How does Fitbit devices calculate the intensity?

Fitbit devices calculate activity intensity  using a combination of data from a 3-axis accelerometer and heart rate monitoring (some models). The accelerometer tracks movement patterns and determine the frequency, duration, and intensity of them to estimate activity levels. Heart rate data, when available, provides additional insights into the strain on the cardiovascular system, particularly for activities like weight lifting or yoga that may not be well-represented by steps alone.

1. Accelerometer Data:

-   Fitbit devices use a 3-axis accelerometer to measure movement in three dimensions.
    
-   This sensor detects acceleration, which is the rate of change of velocity, and this data is used to infer steps taken and the intensity of movement.
    
-   Proprietary algorithms analyze the accelerometer data to identify patterns of motion, distinguishing between different activities and their intensities.
    
-   For example, a higher frequency and magnitude of acceleration changes would be classified as a more intense activity.
    

2. Heart Rate Data (when available):

-   Some Fitbit devices incorporate heart rate sensors (optical or PPG sensors) that measure the rate at which your heart beats.
    
-   Heart rate data is used to determine Active Zone Minutes (AZM), which are a measure of time spent in fat burn, cardio, and peak heart rate zones during exercise.
    
-   These zones are based on a percentage of your maximum heart rate, with higher percentages indicating more intense activity.
    
-   Heart rate data is particularly useful for activities that are not easily tracked by steps alone, such as weightlifting, yoga, or rowing.
    

3. Intensity Levels:

-   Fitbit devices categorize activity intensity into levels, often including sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous.
    
-   These levels are determined by a combination of accelerometer data and heart rate data (when available).
    
-   Fitbit uses a concept called Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) to quantify the energy expenditure of different activities.
    
-   Activities with a MET value of 3 or higher are generally classified as moderate-intensity activities and contribute to active minutes.
    

4. Active Minutes:

-   Fitbit awards "Active Minutes" for time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, based on the intensity levels mentioned above.
    
-   To earn active minutes, the device typically needs to detect at least 10 minutes of continuous activity at or above a certain intensity threshold (e.g., 3 METs).
    
-   Some devices also offer "Active Zone Minutes," which are based on heart rate zones and provide a more personalized measure of intensity.

## What are Active Zone Minutes or active minutes on my Fitbit device?

Earn Active Zone Minutes or active minutes based on your device with heart-pumping activity throughout the day.

## How do I earn active minutes?

Earn active minutes through 10 minutes or more of continuous moderate-to-intense activity.

## How does my Fitbit device calculate active minutes?

Fitbit devices calculate active minutes through metabolic equivalents (METs). This metric, which factors in your body mass, is used to estimate exercise intensity. METs are calculated through a ratio 

Rate of energy expended during an activity : rate of energy expended during rest

1 MET is the rate of energy you expend during rest or sitting quietly, while you typically expend 3 METs or more during a moderately-intense activity such as walking. You earn active minutes for activities at or above about 3 METs.

***If your Fitbit device tracks heart rate, your heart-rate data is used to calculate active minutes for non-step-based activities***, such as weight lifting, yoga, and rowing. If your device doesn’t track heart rate, your active minutes for these activities will be lower.


## How does Fitbit device calculate calories burned?

Fitbit devices combine your basal metabolic rate (BMR)—the rate at which you burn calories at rest to maintain vital body functions (including breathing, blood circulation, and heartbeat)—and your activity data to estimate your calories burned. If your device tracks heart rate, your heart-rate data is also included, especially to estimate calories burned during exercise. The number you see on your Fitbit device is your total calories burned for the day.

Your BMR is based on the physical data you entered in to your Fitbit account (height, weight, sex, and age) and accounts for at least half the calories you burn in a day. Because your body burns calories even if you’re asleep or not moving, you see calories burned on your device when you wake up and will notice this number increase throughout the day.

## How does my Fitbit device detect my sleep stages?

Fitbit estimates your sleep stages by using your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you don't move for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes you're asleep. Additional data such as the length of time when your movements indicate sleep behavior (like rolling over), help confirm your sleep status.

While you sleep, your device tracks the beat-to-beat changes in your heart rate, known as heart rate variability (HRV), which fluctuate as you transition between light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep stages. When you sync your device in the morning, it uses your movement and heart rate patterns to estimate your sleep cycles from the previous night.
